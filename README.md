# Implementation of Slepian-Duguid theorem in a three-stage rearrangable network.

Simulation of the 3-stage rearrangeable Slepian-Duguid network. Use of Paul matrix to setup connections and perform rearrangements.
Generation of permutations. Statistics about number of rearrangements and computation complexity.

## State of a three-stage network represented by the Paull matrix.
* It has r1 rows and r3 columns
* Each matrix entry has up to r2 distinct symbols: 1, 2, ..., r2.
* The symbol a in the matrix entry means that an inlet of the first-stage matrix i is connected to an outlet of the last-stage matrix j through the middlestage matrix a

### Conditions of the Paull matrix
* At most min(n,r2) distinct symbols per row.
* At most min(r2,m) distinct symbols per column.

### Slepian-Duguid theorem
A 3-stage network is RNB if and only if r2 â‰¥ max(n,m)
